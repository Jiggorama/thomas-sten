            Iâ€™m a perpetually curious and enthusiastic software engineer with over 15 years of military experience. I work well on a team as either a leader or team member, and I am adapted to fast-paced environments with a keen eye for detail. My passion for learning combined with my optimistic demeanor has resulted in a richly rewarding experience as a software engineer while I continue to grow with each exciting new challenge I undertake.
